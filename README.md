## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I have learned more things in HTML and CSS. Apart from this I have learned Bootstrap which makes my site responsive, without more coding for that.

### Continued development

I need to know more in Bootstrap to build the site and to know about flex box, which will make to align the content properly.

### Useful resources

- [W3-Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) - It will help to make our site responsive.
